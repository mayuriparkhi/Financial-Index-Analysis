# Financial-Index-Analysis

In my recent project, I developed a comprehensive data model to analyze financial indices using Python. This involved creating a robust class hierarchy to represent various financial instruments and their attributes. I processed a dataset of 10,001 indices, addressing missing values through mode and mean imputation. 

Visualized the data to uncover key insights, including price distributions, company counts, and the lack of correlation between fluctuation rates and prices. This project demonstrated advanced data manipulation, analysis, and visualization techniques, highlighting the power of Python in financial analytics.
